<p>This product is meant for folks who can type fast, spend most of the time near a computer, and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands. Therefore, <mark>Command Line Interface (CLI) is the primary mode of input.</mark></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Constraint-CLI</strong>: Command Line Interface is the primary mode of input. The GUI should be used primarily to give visual feedback to the user rather than to collect input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize
        button), but the primary input should be command-driven. Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and typing is preferred over key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse or key combinations.</li>
