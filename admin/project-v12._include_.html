<p><strong>Submission</strong>: Update code in GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>: Criteria to consider this milestone as reached</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new version has been released on GitHub.</li>
  <li>The new version has moved towards v2.0</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v12-documentation">v1.2 Documentation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>User Guide</strong>: Update as necessary.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a feature has been released in this version, replace the <code>Coming in v2.0</code> annotation with a <code>Since v1.2</code>. Also replace UI mockups with actual screenshots.</li>
      <li>If a feature design has changed, update the descriptions accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Developer Guide</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each member should describe the implementation of at least one feature she is adding. <br> Expected length: ~1 page per person</li>
      <li>The description can contain things such as,
        <ul>
          <li>How the feature is implemented.</li>
          <li>Why it is implemented that way.</li>
          <li>Alternatives considered.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The stated objective is to explain the implementation to a future developer, but a hidden objective is to show evidence that you can document deeply technical matters using prose, examples, diagrams, code snippets, etc. appropriately. To that end,
        you may also describe features that you plan to implement in the future, even beyond v1.5 (hypothetically).</li>
      <li>For an example, see the description of the undo/redo feature implementation in the AddressBook-Level4 developer guide.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
